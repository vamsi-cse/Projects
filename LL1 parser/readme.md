An LL1 parser is a type of top-down parser used in computer science to analyze and validate code syntax. This parser uses a predictive parsing technique, where the parser predicts the next token in the input stream and matches it with the expected token. Implementing an LL1 parser involves adding Grammar Augmentation, Removing Left Recursion, Removing Left Factoring, Calculating First and Follow sets and constructing a parse table and using it to parse the input. The LL(1) parser implementation utilizes stack and buffer data structures to validate input strings. In this parsing technique we start parsing from the top (start symbol of parse tree) to down (the leaf node of parse tree) in a top-down manner.
