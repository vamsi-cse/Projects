 Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown promising results in emotion 
recognition tasks. Telugu, one of the major languages spoken 
in India, has not received much attention in emotion 
recognition from speech signals using deep learning 
techniques. In this report, we aim to investigate the 
performance of deep learning algorithms for emotion 
detection in Telugu speech signals. The quickest and most 
natural form of human communication is speech. We assess 
the emotional state of the person we are interacting with and 
respond to them appropriately in our daily interactions. 
Spoken emotion recognition is tough and complex for a 
number of reasons. how well different speech parameters 
may identify emotions in Telugu speech. We here make use 
of 550 audio signals of Telugu emotional speech that spans 
five emotional categories: surprise, anger, happiness, 
neutrality, and sadness.
